UBL Simulation
===============

This is a placeholder for the updated UBL Sim project with view-switching lineup editor.

Lineup CSV Format
-----------------
Lineup files live in `data/lineups/` and are named `<TEAM>_vs_lhp.csv` or `<TEAM>_vs_rhp.csv`.
Each file contains the columns:

```
order,player_id,position
```

`player_id` uses the internal player IDs such as `P1000`.
