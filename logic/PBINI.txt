; There are several basic things to know about making changes to these entries
;
;   1. Entries must be integer values (either positive or negative).
;   2. Comments must be preceded by a semicolon (;).
;   3. All final chances will be clamped between 0 and 100 percent.
;   4. Thresholds will be specified as either minimum or maximum in the
;       entry description.
;   5. Spaces may be used between the "=" and the entry name and value.
;   6. Due to an undocumented "feature" in Windows, all .ini files must be
;      less than 60,000 bytes in size.  This means that you must edit out all
; 	 these comments if you intend to use this file as a basis for your PB.INI.
;      We recommend that you instead create a new PB.INI file and only insert the
;      entries you wish to change from the default values.
;
; There are several different basic types of entries in this file:
;
;       Base Value - The value is used as the base chance that the specified
;                   event or decision will occur.
;
;       Percent Modifier - The value is used as a multiplier on the specified
;                   chance, using the formula:  ( PctMod * SpecChance / 100 ).
;                   A percent modifier value of 100 is the same as multiplying
;                   the specified chance by 1.  A value of 0 will nullify the
;                   specified chance.
;
;       Adjustment - The value is added to the specified chance, using the
;                   formula: ( Adjust + SpecChance ).  A negative value will
;                   reduce the chance and a positive value will increase it.
;
;       Distribution - To obtain a non-linear chance distribution, we use
;                   three entries labeled Count, Faces, and Base.  These
;                   are used to generate a "dice roll", using the formula:
;                   (( Count dice Faces ) + Base ).  Increasing the Count
;                   will cause the increases the height of the distribution
;                   curve while increasing the Faces increases the width of
;                   the curve.  Base is used to bring the average result to
;                   zero or center.
;
;       Weights -  Weights are used to determine the random chance a specific
;                   event occurs out of a group of events.  Each event has a
;                   chance equal to it's value divided by the sum of the values
;                   of all the entries in the group.
;
;       Dividers - A divider used to reduce the value, using the formula:
;                   ( value / divider ).

; OUTFIELDER POSITIONING
; During normal situations, both the extreme and "extra" shifts are used
; based on the batter's pull rating.  PosHighPull/PosLowPull are the extreme
; shifts and should have higher pull rating values than the PosHighPullExtra/
; PosLowPullExtra values.  In close and late situations, you won't want your
; outfielders shifting to the extremes, so only the PosHighPullExtra and
; PosLowPullExtra values are used.  High pull values will shift an outfield
; to the right against a left-handed hitter or to the left against a right-
; handed hitter.  The following descriptions assume a left-handed hitter.
;
defPosHighPull=80           ; PL rating value to shift OFs right twice

;
; With high PH rated players, OF's play back a little further and with low PH,
; they play a little closer in.

defPosLowPower=20           ; Max PH value to cause OFs to play in

; ******************************** SUBSTITUTIONS ******************************
; The substitutions entries include those that control the chance that the
; manager will:
;
;   1. use a pinch hit
;       a. for the current pitcher
;       b. in a "need a hit/baserunner" situation
;       c. in a "need a run/RBI" situation
;   2. use a pinch runner
;   3. make a defensive substitution
;   4. do a double switch to move the pitcher's batting slot
;   5. relieve the current pitcher (including warming up relievers)
;
;
; COMBINED RATINGS
; Some of the substitution formulas use special "combined" ratings, called
; Offense, Slugging, and Defense, calculated using the formulas:
;       Offense - ((( 2 * CH * PH ) + ( CH * CH )) / ( PH + 2 * CH + 1 ))
;       Slugging - ((( 2 * PH * CH ) + ( PH * PH )) / ( CH + 2 * PH + 1 ))
;       Defense - ((( 2 * FA * AS ) + ( FA * FA )) / ( AS + 2 * FA + 1 ))
;
; Adjustments to each factor in the combined ratings formulas
;
offRatCHPct=100     ; Percentage multiplier to CH in Offense formula
offRatPHPct=100     ; Percentage multiplier to PH in Offense formula
slugRatCHPct=100    ; Percentage multiplier to CH in Slugging formula

; PITCHER WARMUP TIMES
; Pitchers require between 20 to 25 pitches to get warmed up (starters require
; 40-45).  When warming up, they will throw one pitch every XX seconds, as
; specified in the entry.  After warmup, pitchers may either continue throwing
; in the bullpen or may sit down.  If the pitcher continues to throw he will
; use a pitch from his available pitches every XX seconds, as specified in the
; entry.  If the pitcher sits down, he will cool down by losing the pitches he
; threw to get warm, at a rate of one pitch every XX seconds, as specified in
; the entry.  When he reaches half the total required to get warm, he gets his
; condition declassified to "half" from "warm" and when he reaches 0 pitches,
; he is considered "cold".  Regardless of the number of pitches required
; to get warm and the interval between cool down pitches, the pitcher will be
; considered "cold" after XX seconds, as specified in the entry.  If a pitcher
; starts warming up again before he becomes completely cold, he will acquire
; pitches toward getting to warm status from the number of pitches he had left
; toward warm status.

; Control box sizes
; Whenever a pitch is thrown a control check is made on the pitch.  If the
; check is passed it will end up within the area the pitcher aiming the
; pitch, which is called the "control box".  The control box is centered on
; the aim point, with any "slop" being applied up and out of the strike zone.
; If the pitch misses the control check the control box is increased in size
; by one square in both height and width based on a percentage of the pitcher's
; effective control for that pitch.  The pitch will then end up anywhere within
; the newly enlarged control box, and could presumably end up exactly where it
; was aimed.

; Pitch curve/break parameters
; When the pitcher wants to hit a certain spot with the pitch, he must
; consider the amount of break he expects to get on the pitch.  These entries
; represent how much a pitch will "break" from this "phantom" aiming point.
; If a pitch "hangs" or fails to break it will end up within a control box
; centered on the phantom aim point, otherwise it will end up within a control
; box centered on the actual aim point.
;
; The Base Width parameters specify the number of squares the pitch will break
; to the RIGHT of the phantom aim point.  A negative width will mean the pitch
; will break to the left.  Similarly, the base Height parameters specify the
; number of squares the pitch will break UPWARD of it's phantom aim point.  A
; negative value will move the pitch downwards, as most pitches do.
; The Range parameters specify the maximum number of squares to add to the
; Width or Height, determined randomly from 0 to the number specified.

; ******************************** BATTER AI **********************************
; The batter AI entries include those that effect the batter's:
;
;   1. strike zone determination
;   2. chance of looking for certain types of pitches on certain counts.  Look
;       location is determined by the locations the pitcher has proven he can
;       throw the pitch for a strike.
;   3. chance of identifying the pitch parameters (type, velocity, location)
;   4. swing timing
;   5. amount of adjustment from look to actual pitch parameters
;   6. discipline to NOT swing at a "bad pitch"
;   7. chance of checking a swing after secondary identification
;   8. Chance of avoiding a pitch that would otherwise hit him
;
; STRIKE ZONE DETERMINATION
; The strike zone is a broken down into a 9x9 grid, with 0,0 being considered
; the middle of zone, horizontally and vertically.  A pitch is considered to
; be either a sure strike, a close strike, a close ball, or a sure ball.
; The values here are how far from 0,0 to call a particular class of pitch.
; The number of squares out from center to classify the parts of the zone.
;

;
; LOOK FOR PITCH TYPE ADJUSTMENTS
; The batter will "look" for a specific pitch type on each count.  Each
; pitch type is given a weight based on the formula:
;         ( PitchRating * times_thrown_for_strike / time_thrown )
; These entries serve to add weight to the final pitch rating percentage
; for the pitcher's primary pitch (FB, SI, or KN, whichever is dominant)
; or to the pitcher's best rated pitch.

; PITCH IDENTIFICATION
; The chance that a batter will identify any of the three components of the
; pitch is based on the formula:
;       Base + (( CH + EXP + (100 - PitchRating) / 2 )
;
idRatingBase=44             ; Base identification chance

idRatingLocWeight=100       ; Percent multiplier on chance to ID pitch location
idRatingTimingWeight=100    ; Percent multiplier on chance to ID pitch timing
;
; SWING TIMING
; Assuming a proper ID, batter swing timing is a bell curve around the mid
; point of the swing.  The following 5 timing elements determine the height
; and width of the bell curve and the maximum base ID chance that particular
; curve should be used on.  Lower CH values have lower curve heights a greater
; curve widths meaning that it is harder to get exact timing.
;
; Note:  Curves are built from a "dice roll" formula using COUNT number of
; dice with FACES number of sides to the die and subtracting BASE from the
; result so that it centers on 0.  Note that die can have an odd number of
; faces.
;

;
; SWING ADJUSTMENT
; If a batter originally misidentifies a pitch location or timing, he gets a
; second chance at identifying that element.  If he does identify a more
; correct location or timing, he will need to adjust his original swing to the
; new location or timing.  The adjustments are measured in "units".  A unit is
; either a one of the squares in the 9x9 strike zone grid or are timing units.
;
adjustUnitsCHPct=100
adjustUnitsPowerPct=75
adjustUnitsContactPct=150
;
; SWING ADJUSTMENT UNITS
; These controls allow you to set how many adjustment "units" it costs
; the batter to adjust his swing in each direction.
;
; Units in the horizontal and vertical planes are each small (9x9)
; square in the strike zone (and without).
;
; Timing units are a little more complicated and work this way:
;    1. Get the difference between the final timing ID speed and the
;       first timing ID speed (ID - 1stID), measured as the number of
;       inches difference between hitting the ball squarely for
;       each ID'd pitch speed.  This is the amount of timing adjustment
;       needed to make good contact.
;
;       For example:  If the batter first IDs the pitch as being 85 mph,
;       he will start his swing such that the ball and bat will meet in the
;       center of the swing.  The next time he IDs the pitch as being 90 mph,
;       so when the ball gets to the point where it would have met the bat
;       according to his calculation, and how he started his swing, the bat
;       is still XX inches behind the swing apex (look it up in the table).
;
;    2. Each batter has a "geared speed" which is the speed of pitch to which
;       he is "geared up" to hit and which starts at 86 mph.  If a pitch comes
;       in faster than the geared speed, the batter must speed up his swing to
;       hit the pitch, otherwise he must slow it down.  It is far easier adjust
;       a swing to a slower pitch than it is to a faster pitch.
;
;       As the batter sees pitches in the game, he will start to adjust his
;       geared speed to the velocity of the pitches he is seeing, so if you
;       have a knuckleball starter followed by a fireballing reliever, the
;       reliever will be much more effective than he would be if following
;       a normal pitcher.
;
;    3. The amount of timing adjustment needed is multiplied by the
;       appropriate factor to get the number of timing adjustment units
;       needed to adjust the swing to make good contact, which is added to
;       the number of location adjustment units to get the total.
;
;    4. The batter gets a number of adjustment units based on the specified
;       percent multiplier on his CH rating.

;
; SWING DISCIPLINE
; When the pitch isn't a good one to hit, the batter needs to pass a
; discipline check to NOT swing at the pitch.  The discipline check is
; made (meaning the batter WILL NOT swing) if a random number from 0-100
; falls below the discipline rating value for that pitch.
;
; The base discipline rating is calculated as:
