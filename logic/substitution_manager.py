"""Utility class handling mid game substitution logic.

The real game features a large amount of logic that decides when teams will
replace players during the game.  For the purposes of the unit tests in this
repository we only model a very small, deterministic subset of that behaviour.

``SubstitutionManager`` centralises these decisions so that the main
``GameSimulation`` class can delegate the various checks to a single place.
Each method operates on the mutable ``TeamState`` structure used by the
simulation and will append a human readable entry to ``log`` whenever a change
occurs.  The log is later displayed in the exhibition game dialog so that the
user can manually verify that substitutions occurred.
